# DSA Implementation (Python, JavaScript, C++)

This repo is my ongoing effort to implement the most common data structures and algorithms in different languages. I believe it is very beneficial to compare and contrast what each language can and cannot do so that we can develop a mental model of when to use what. I hope you find this resource helpful. I organize this repo into 4 folders, each folder consists of subfolders including: sorting algorithms, trees, dynamic programming, and graphs.

## Table of Contents
- [Sorting Algorithms](#sorting-algorithms)
- [Trees](#trees)
- [Greedy Algorithms](#greedy-algorithms)
- [Dynamic Programming](#dynamic-programming)

## Sorting Algorithms
Check out the empirical experiments in this [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1aOCxGSlI88Zf_GA2lTMU5oEfXIPLuu1J?authuser=1).
